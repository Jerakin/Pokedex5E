  "Description": "You cloak yourself in fire and charge at a creature with serious damage. Make a melee attack against a creature, dealing fire damage on a hit. On a hit, you take a quarter of the damage dealt in typeless recoil damage. On a natural attack roll of 19 or 20, the target is burned. If the user is frozen, this move can still be used, thawing out the creature during the attack",
