  "Description": "You clamp down on a target, attempting to deal damage and keep them in place. Make a melee attack roll. On a hit, the target takes water damage and is grappled. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to pry itself away with a STR save against your Move DC. As long as the target is grappled on your subsequent turns, this move can be activated again as a bonus action with an automatic hit, dealing water damage.",
