  "Description": "You use up all the fire energy you have to inflict massive damage in a 30 foot circle, centered on you. Creatures within the area must make a DEX save against your Move DC. On a failure, the creature take fire damage and become burned. On a success, they take half as much damage without being burned. After using this move, the user burns itself out and loses its fire-typing for the remainder of combat. Dual-type fire Pokemon change to their single other type, and single-type Pokemon become typeless, losing STAB and all vulnerabilites, resistances, and immunities.",
