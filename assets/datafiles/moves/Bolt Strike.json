  "Description": "You send down a powerful strike of lightning from the heavens, surrounding an area of the battlefield with surging electricity. Any creature caught in a 20 foot radius, centered on a point within range, must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking electric damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more, it becomes paralyzed.",
