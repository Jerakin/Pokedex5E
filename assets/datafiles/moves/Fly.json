  "Description": "You fly high into the air to prepare for a dive bomb attack. When you activate this move, you flap your wings and disappear into the Ethereal plane above you. You cannot be targeted by attacks while you are in the Ethereal plane. On your next turn, you use your action to reappear and make a diving melee attack on a creature in range, with advantage, dealing flying damage on a successful hit.",
