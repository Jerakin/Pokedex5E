  "Description": "You fly high into the air to prepare for a dive bomb attack. When you activate this move, you use 10 feet of your movement to vanish and fly upwards, remaining in an invulnerable state until your next turn. During this time, you are immune to the damage and effects of any move. If you have no remaining movement or are grappled/restrained before activating this move, the move fails. On your next turn, you use your action to reappear and make a diving melee attack on a creature in range, with advantage, dealing flying damage on a successful hit.",
