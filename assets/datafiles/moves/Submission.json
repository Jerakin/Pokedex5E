  "Description": "You attempt a forceful grapple on a target. Make a melee attack, doing fighting damage on a hit, but taking a quarter of the damage dealt in recoil. On a hit, the target is grappled. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. While a creature is grappled, this move can be activated again as a bonus action with an automatic hit, dealing fighting damage with a quarter of the damage dealt in typeless recoil.",
