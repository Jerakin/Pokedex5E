  "Description": "When you use this move, strong winds begin to circle around you, granting +2 to AC. On your next turn, if you keep your concentration, you release those winds as an action in a 20 foot radius, centered on you. Each creature in the area must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking normal damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.",
