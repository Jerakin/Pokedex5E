  "Description": "You attempt to summon a wave of sand that surrounds your opponent. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, the target takes ground damage and is restrained. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. While a creature is restrained, you may continue this move, as a bonus action, to do an automatic ground damage without having to make an attack roll.",
