  "Description": "You create a wave of water that swirls around an opponent in range. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, the target takes water damage and is restrained. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. On each successive turn, if the creature is still restrained, you may use this move again (as an action) and automatically hit.",
