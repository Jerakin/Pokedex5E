  "Description": "You roll into a targete, repeatedly making attacks with increasing strength. Make a melee attack on a creature, dealing rock damage on a hit. If you use this move on your turn in consecutive rounds, double the dice on each successful attack for a maximum of 5 attacks, in which case the damage would reset. Ex: on first hit, on second, , , . The damage resets if any of the attacks fail to damage a creature, if your speed is reduced to 0, or if you are incapacitated.",
