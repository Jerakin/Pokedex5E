  "Description": "You hurl a mass of sticky sludge that may poison creatures in its blast. Make a ranged attack roll against a target. On a hit, the target takes poison damage and the area in a 5 foot radius around it is covered in sludge until the beginning of your next turn. Any creature that enters this area for the first time on their turn, or is in that area at the beginning of their turn must make a CON save against your Move DC or become poisoned.",
