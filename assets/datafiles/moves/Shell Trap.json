  "Description": "You set a shell trap that explodes in a 5ft radius. As a bonus action on the initial activation of this move, you set a trap on yourself. Only one trap may be set at a time. When you are hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to detonate the trap. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DEX save against your Move DC, rolling at disadvantage, taking fire damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.",
