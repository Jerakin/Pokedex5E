  "Description": "You strike with a simultaneous three-beam attack. Each creature in a 30 foot cone, centered on you, must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking normal damage on a fail, and half as much on a success. Targets that fail the save by 5 or more must roll a d4, gaining the status condition as follows: 1. The target becomes burned. 2. The target becomes frozen. 3. The target becomes paralyzed. 4. Must reroll until any number other than 4 appears.",
