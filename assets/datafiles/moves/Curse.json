  "Description": "This Move has a different effect based on your creature type. If you are ghost-type: You attempt to put a curse on a creature. Force a target in range to make a WIS saving throw against your Move DC. On a fail, the target is cursed. You take damage initially and the target takes ghost damage at the end of each of its turns for the duration. If you are any other type: You place a curse on yourself. For the duration, your STR and CON scores increase by 2, but your DEX score decreases by 4.",
