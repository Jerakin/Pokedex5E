  "Description": "You cause an uproar on the battlefield in a 60 foot circle, centered on you, for three rounds of combat. During the uproar, your action is spent continuing the move (without spending PP), and any creature in range wakes and is prevented from falling asleep. (This include creatures that would purposefully fall asleep using moves like Rest) In addition, creatures in the area at the start of their turns must make a CON save against your Move DC, taking normal damage on a fail, or half as much on a success.",
