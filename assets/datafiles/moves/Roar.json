  "Description": "You release an intimidating roar at all opponents within 15 feet of you. Opponents that can hear you must make a WIS save against your Move DC. On a fail, the creature is frightened and is forced to immediately move up to its speed in a straight line away from its attacker, or until met with an impeding force (this forced movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity). A creature frightened in this way must make a WIS save at the end of each of its turns against your Move DC to remove the effect.",
