  "Description": "You slam your scaled hands together to create an intense, sound-based shockwave in a 30 foot cone in front of you. Any creature caught in the blast must make a CON save against your Move DC, taking dragon damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more reduce their AC by 1 for the remainder of combat.",
