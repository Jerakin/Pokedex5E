  "Description": "When you use this move, you charge up an intense power within your body. On your next turn's action, if you keep your concentration, you unleash an ultracold, freezing wind in a 60 foot circle all around you. Anyone caught in the blast must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking ice damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. If any creature fails the save by 5 or more, it is burned.",
