  "Description": "When you use this move, you charge up an intense power within your body. On your next turnâ€™s action, if you keep your concentration, you unleash an ultracold, freezing wind in a 30 foot circle all around you. Anyone caught in the blast must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking ice damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. If any creature fails the save by more than 5, it is burned.",
