  "Description": "You embrace the damage done to you, waiting for your time to strike. Use your attack action to activate this move, and keep track of all damage done to you before your next turn. On your next turn, you lash out at an enemy with a normal ranged attack, striking them for double the amount of damage you took on a successful hit. At 10th Level, you can choose to hold Bide for a second turn for the chance to add additional damage to the attack.",
