  "Description": "When you activate this move, you use 10 feet of your movement to disappear into a magical space beneath your feet, remaining in an invulnerable state until your next turn. During this time, you are immune to the damage and effects of any move. If you have no remaining movement or are grappled/restrained before activating this move, the move fails. On your next turn, as an action, you reappear and attempt to attack a creature from below. Make a melee attack roll on a creature in range, with advantage, doing water damage on a hit.",
