  "Description": "Icy clouds form overhead and pelt the ground with hail and snow, centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 30 ft radius, centered on a point within range, must make a DEX saving throw against your Move DC, taking ice damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Targets that fail the save by 5 or more become frozen.",
