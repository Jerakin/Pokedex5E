  "Description": "You unleash sticky string at a creature in range, slowing it down. Make a ranged attack roll against a target. On a hit, the target's speed is reduced by 10 for the duration. The move is stackable to any amount. The target may take an action to attempt to get rid of any string with a STR save against your Move DC. If this reduction in speed causes their speed to be 0, they are restrained.",
