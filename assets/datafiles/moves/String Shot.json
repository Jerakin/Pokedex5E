  "Description": "You unleash sticky string at a creature in range, slowing it down. Make a ranged attack roll against a target. On a hit, the targetâ€™s speed is reduced by 10 for the duration. The move is stackable to any amount. The target may take an action to attempt to get rid of any string with a STR save against your Move DC. If this reduction in speed causes their speed to be 0, they are restrained.",
