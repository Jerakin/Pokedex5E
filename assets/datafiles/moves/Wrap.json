  "Description": "You attempt to grapple a target into submission. Make a melee attack roll. On a hit, the target takes normal damage and is grappled. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. As long as the target is grappled on your subsequent turns, this move can be activated again as a bonus action with an automatic hit, dealing normal damage.",
