  "Description": "Explosive projectiles rain down upon creatures in a 10 foot radius, centered on a point within range. Any creature caught in the blast must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking fire damage on a fail and half as much on a success. This move saps you of energy, and you may not make any attack until after the end of your next turn.",
