  "Description": "You release a massive explosion in a 30 foot radius, fainting immediately after the attack. Creatures in the area must make a DEX save against your Move DC. If your creature has at least half its hit points left, anyone in range takes normal damage on a fail, or half as much on a success. If your creature has less than half of its hitpoints left, the damage is halved for a failed save, and quartered for a success.",
