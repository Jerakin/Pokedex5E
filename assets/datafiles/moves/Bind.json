  "Description": "You attempt to grapple a target into submission. Make a melee attack roll. On a hit, the target takes normal damage and is grappled. At the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. While a creature is grappled, you may continue this move, as a bonus action, to do an automatic normal damage without having to make an attack roll.",
