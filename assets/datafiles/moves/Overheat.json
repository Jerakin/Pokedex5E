  "Description": "With a roar, flames burst from your body in a 30 foot circle, centered on you. Any creature in range must roll a DEX saving throw against your Move DC, taking fire damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. The power of the move exhausts you, and your next attack is done at disadvantage. If your next attack requires a creature saving throw, they have advantage.",
