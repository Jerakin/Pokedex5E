  "Description": "You conjure a line of smoke on the battlefield, 60 feet long and 5 feet thick, that extends in any direction from a point within range. The area on either side is obscured and imposes disadvantage on any ranged attacks made by a creature targeting another on the opposite side. Any creature inside the wall of smoke, when it is conjured, must make a CON save against your Move DC or become blinded for the duration. A blinded creature can repeat the save at the beginning of its turns to remove the effect on a success.",
