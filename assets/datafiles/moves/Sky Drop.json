  "Description": "You reach out in an attempt to lift an opponent up in the air for a slamming attack. When you activate this move, make a melee attack roll. On a hit, the target is grappled. The target may use its next action to attempt a STR save against your Move DC to get free. If it does not succeed, and you maintain your concentration, you may use your action on your next turn to lift the creature into the air, dropping it to the ground for flying damage. Flying-type creatures or ones under the effect of \"Levitate\", \"Magnet Rise\" or other similar abilities/moves are not damaged.",
