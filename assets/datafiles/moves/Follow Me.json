  "Description": "You act quickly to entice an enemy to attack you. When a creature in range activates a Move, you may use your reaction to force the creature to make a CHA save against your Move DC. On a fail, the Move must target you. If the target's Move cannot target a creature other than itself, it fails. If the Move's range is melee, the creature is forced to immediately use their remaining movement to move in a straight line towards you before making the attack (does not provoke attacks of opportunity).",
