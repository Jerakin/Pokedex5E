  "Description": "You send a seed at a creature in range that implants itself in their hide. Make a ranged attack roll. On a hit, a seed implants into their skin. The target takes grass damage at the end of each of its subsequent turns until it faints or is switched out. Half of the damage is restored by the attacker, or any other active creature the trainer has in battle, even if the original attacker faints or is returned to its Pok√©ball. Only one creature can be seeded by the attacker at a time.",
