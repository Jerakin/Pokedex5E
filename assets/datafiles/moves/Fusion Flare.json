  "Description": "You summon a gigantic fireball that strikes down from the heavens in a 60 foot circle, centered on a point within range. All creatures caught in the blast must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking fire damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. If Fusion Flare was already used this round, double the damage dealt. Fusion Flare may be used to thaw out the user from the frozen status before attacking.",
