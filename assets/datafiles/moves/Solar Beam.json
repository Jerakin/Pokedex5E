  "Description": "When you use this move, soak in solar energy and prepare to unleash a devastating beam. On your next turn, if you keep your concentration, use an action to create a 80 foot line of solar energy, 5 feet wide. Any creature caught in the line must succeed on a DEX save or take grass damage on a fail and half as much on a save. If this move is used in harsh sunlight, double your MOVE modifier for damage and it can be used on the turn it is activated, without concentration.",
