  "Description": "You summon a collection of boulders that attempt to surround a target. Force a creature in range to make a STR saving throw against your Move DC, taking rock damage and becoming restrained on a failure, or half as much without being restrained on a success. If it fails, at the beginning of each of its turns, it may attempt to escape with a STR save against your Move DC. While a creature is restrained, you may continue this move, as an action, to deal an automatic rock damage.",
