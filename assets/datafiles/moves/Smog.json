  "Description": "You create a fog of poisonous smog in a 15 foot radius, centered on a point within range. Creatures that begin their turn in the area take poison damage and must succeed on a CON save against your Move DC or become poisoned. The area of smog is considered difficult terrain, and any attacks made from inside it are done at disadvantage. The smog cloud dissipates at the beginning of your next turn.",
