  "Description": "You send an extremely powerful wave of psychic energy at creatures in a 60 foot cone. Creatures in the wave must make a WIS save against your Move DC, taking psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. The power of the move exhausts you, and your next attack is done at disadvantage. If your next attack requires a creature saving throw, they have advantage.",
