  "Description": "You fire a powerful stream of high-speed water at creatures in a 80 foot line, 5 feet wide. Any creature caught in the blast must make a DEX saving throw against your Move DC, taking water damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.. Creatures that fail the save also are pushed back 10 feet and fall prone. This move saps you of energy, and you may not make any attack until after the end of your next turn.",
