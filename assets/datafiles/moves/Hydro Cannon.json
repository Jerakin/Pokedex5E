  "Description": "You fire a powerful stream of high-speed water at creatures in a 80 foot line, 5 feet wide. Any creature caught in the blast must make a STR saving throw against your Move DC, taking water damage on a failure, and half as much on a success.. Creatures that fail the save also are pushed back 10 feet and fall prone. This move saps you of energy, and may not activate any move until after the end of your next turn.",
