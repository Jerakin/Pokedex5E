  "Description": "You strike out with an incredibly fast spinning move. All creatures within melee range must make a DEX save against your Move DC, taking normal damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. In addition, this move automatically frees the user from Leech Seed or anything causing it to be grappled or restrained. It is removed from these statuses before the saving throw is made.",
