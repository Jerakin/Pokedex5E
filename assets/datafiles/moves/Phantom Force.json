  "Description": "You disappear from view and prepare to surprise your target with an attack. When you activate this move, you become invisible and immune to any attacks of opportunity. You cannot be targeted by attacks while you are invisible. On your next turn, you use your action to reappear and make a melee attack against a creature, with advantage, dealing ghost damage on a successful hit. Protect and Detect reactions may not be used when hit by this attack.",
