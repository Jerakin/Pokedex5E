  "Description": "You whip up a maelstorm of harsh winds. Each creature in a 30 ft radius, centered on a point within range, must make a STR saving throw against your Move DC, taking flying damage and knocked prone on a failure, or half as much damage without being knocked prone on a success. Targets that fail the saving throw by 5 or more become confused. If this attack is activated during rain, the targets roll their saving throws with disadvantage. If used during harsh sunlight, the targets roll their saves with advantage.",
