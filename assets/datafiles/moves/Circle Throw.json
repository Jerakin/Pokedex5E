  "Description": "You swing the target around and throw it as hard as you can, away from the battlefield. Make a melee attack, dealing fighting damage on a hit. In wild battles, the target takes the damage and flees from battle if its level is lower than that of the user. In trainer battles, the target takes the damage and must be immediately switched out for another creature in the trainer's party, if any remain.",
