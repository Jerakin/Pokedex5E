  "Description": "You soar upward and come crashing down towards a creature in range at tremendous speed. Make a melee attack roll, dealing flying damage on a hit. Any creature within 10 feet of the target must make a DEX save against your Move DC and take the same amount of damage on a success, or half as much on a fail. After activating this move, any attack roll that targets you until the beginning of your next turn is rolled with advantage.",
