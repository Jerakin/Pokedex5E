# Welcome to Defold

This project was created from the "mobile" project template. This means that the settings in ["game.project"](defold://open?path=/game.project) have been changed to be suitable for a mobile game:

- The screen size is set to 640x1136
- Orientation is fixed vertically
- Android and iOS icons are set
- iOS launch images (blank ones) are set
- Mouse click/single touch is bound to action "touch"
- A simple script in a game object is set up to receive and react to input
- Accelerometer input is turned off (for better battery life)

[Build and run](defold://build) to see it in action. You can of course alter these settings to fit your needs.

Check out [the documentation pages](https://defold.com/learn) for examples, tutorials, manuals and API docs.

If you run into trouble, help is available in [our forum](https://forum.defold.com).

Happy Defolding!
