## Defold
The app is written with a game engine called [Defold](https://defold.com/). I strongly recommend getting to know the engine a bit before jumping into the projects as that could be a bit overwhelming.

Start with doing a few tutorials from [here](https://defold.com/tutorials/getting-started/) they are all really good but for this project I think "[15 Puzzle](https://defold.com/tutorials/15-puzzle/)" and "[Colorslide](https://defold.com/tutorials/colorslide/)". I would recommend to do them all however.
