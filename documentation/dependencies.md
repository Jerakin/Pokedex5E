# Dependencies
[**monarch**](https://github.com/britzl/monarch)  
Screen manager

[**gooey**](https://github.com/britzl/gooey)  
Gui component library

[**extension-safearea**](https://github.com/defold/extension-safearea)  
iPhone X had a notch that if you did not account for you could not release the app. This simply adds a black "letter-box"
so that the notch isn't in the way and thus we can have the app easily on iPhone.

[**GA-SDK-DEFOLD**](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-SDK-DEFOLD)  
Analytics for crashes, the app does have some general tracking but I have never used it.

[**defold-random**](https://github.com/selimanac/defold-random)  
I had issues with the lua's random number generator (more so than the usual) and I opted to use this library to not have to fight with it.

[**defsave**](https://github.com/subsoap/defsave)  
Save tables to disk library

[**defold-clipboard**](https://github.com/britzl/defold-clipboard)

A few editor extensions that adds a bit of "nice to have" to the editor-script

[**set_screen_position**](https://github.com/AGulev/set_screen_position)
Defolds different screen sizes are super annoying to work with, this help by fixing one of the issues. Namely putting
something at a screen position

[**PokemonTypes**](https://github.com/Jerakin/PokemonTypes)  
A library to figure out what type a Pokemon is weak too, written because there was a *lot* of bugs in the typing in the
source data so I opted to simply calculate it myself.

Dependency for GA-SDK-DEFOLD

[**defold-sharing**](https://github.com/britzl/defold-sharing)
